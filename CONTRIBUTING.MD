## Report bugs using Github Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23333) of a bug report someone wrote which has some
valuable information.

Most of the bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce it
    - Be as specific as possible.
    - Provide us a sample code. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Additional notes, including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work.
